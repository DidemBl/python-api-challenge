# python-api-challenge

#Description

In this Challenge you will develop a script to:

1.Visualize weather in over 500 cities around the Equator.

2.Choose a subset of cities from your original list based on specific criteria.

3. Find the first hotel located within 10 km of the specified coordinates for each short-listed city.

#You will complete the assignment based on the following instructions:

WeatherPy

1. Get weather data and coordinates for each city using the OpenWeatherMap API 
2. Plot correlations for the following variables. 

Latitude vs. Temperature

Latitude vs. Humidity

Latitude vs. Cloudiness

Latitude vs. Wind Speed

3. Run a linear regression analysis for each relationship


VacationPy 

1. Plot a map that displays every city with the size of the point being the humidity.  
2. Get a subset of cities that match your ideal weather condition based on a number of criteria that you will determine. 
3. Create a new dataframe and populate it with the city, country, coordinates, and humidity and an empty column for the hotel name. 
4. Get the information for the first hotel located within 10 km of each shortlisted city using the Geoapify API. 
5. Add the hotel name and the country in the hover message for each city.
